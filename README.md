# Meetings
This repository contains meeting logs and notes for the Arch Classroom Project's meetings.

## How meetings are run

Meetings are held in the ```#archlinux-classroom``` irc channel. Items on the Agenda are discussed and notes are taken during the meeting on the results of these discussions. Once the meeting is over the logs and notes are posted to this repository.

## Agenda

The agenda is a restructured text formated file that is updated after every meeting which contains the things to be discussed in the next meeting. Notes for a meeting are developed from the agenda and then archived.
